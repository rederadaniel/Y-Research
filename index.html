    <h1 style="font-size: large;">An Analysis of the Influence of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning on Students' Academic Performance in ICT (Programming):  
    Grade 11's Experience in Using It in Their Tasks and Activities at San Nicholas III Senior High School</h1>
    
    <p class="q">
        "What if the secret to becoming a coding genius isn't more practice — but smarter tools?"  
        <br> The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) might hold the answer.
    </p>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>In the last decade, <span class="highlight">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</span> and <span class="highlight">Machine Learning (ML)</span> have emerged as powerful forces reshaping the world — and education is no exception. From automated writing assistants to intelligent language translation, AI has become an invisible yet influential part of everyday life. But what about programming? Could AI and ML be the game-changers students need to master complex coding challenges?</p>
    
    <p>Programming requires a unique blend of <b>logical thinking</b>, <b>creativity</b>, and <b>problem-solving</b>. Students now have access to AI-driven coding assistants like <b>GitHub Copilot</b>, <b>ChatGPT</b>, and <b>Kite</b>, which can provide real-time suggestions, debug errors, and even write code snippets. These tools promise to make programming easier — but at what cost?</p>
    
    <p>Some educators argue that AI fosters independent learning, while others warn that it could lead to an over-reliance on automated solutions. This study dives deep into how Grade 11 students at San Nicholas III Senior High School are using AI and ML tools in programming tasks — and whether these tools are helping or hindering their academic growth.</p>
    
    <!-- Research Objectives -->
    <h2>Research Objectives</h2>
    <p>The main objectives of this study are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To evaluate the extent to which AI and ML tools influence students' academic performance in programming.</li>
        <li>To identify the specific AI and ML tools used by Grade 11 students and how frequently they are utilized.</li>
        <li>To explore the students' perception of the effectiveness of AI and ML in improving their coding skills and problem-solving abilities.</li>
        <li>To identify the challenges and limitations faced by students when using AI and ML tools in programming tasks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 style="font-size: x-large;">Chapter 1: Background of the Study</h1>
    
    <p>Over the years, AI and ML have transitioned from futuristic concepts to practical tools used in everyday life. In education, they have the potential to revolutionize learning methods and student performance. In the field of ICT, programming remains one of the most complex yet rewarding skills for students to master. AI and ML are now stepping in to help students tackle coding challenges more efficiently.</p>

        "AI tools don’t just automate — they teach. But are students truly learning, or simply following machine-generated solutions?"
    </div>
    
    <p>At San Nicholas III Senior High School, Grade 11 ICT students have been introduced to AI-based platforms like <b>GitHub Copilot</b>, <b>Replit AI</b>, and <b>ChatGPT</b>. These tools analyze coding patterns, suggest real-time corrections, and even generate entire code segments. Students report faster problem-solving and higher confidence when coding — but some educators are concerned about long-term consequences.</p>
    
    <p>The key question remains: Are AI and ML improving students’ programming skills — or creating a dependency on automated solutions? This research aims to answer that question by exploring how AI and ML are shaping the learning experiences and academic performance of Grade 11 students.</p>
    
    <p>The findings of this study could provide valuable insights for educators and policymakers seeking to balance the benefits and limitations of AI in education. More importantly, it could redefine how we teach programming in the AI era.</p>
